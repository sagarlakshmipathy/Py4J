# Py4J - A walkthrough
This project is a simple implementation of [Py4J](https://www.py4j.org/index.html), a Python library that enables Python programs to dynamically access Java objects and methods. The goal of this project is to provide users with a guardrail to implement Py4J in their workflow.

## Getting Started
To get started with Py4J, you will need to have the below in your machine. 
* Java (Java 11 or above) - This project was tested with **Java 11**
* Python (Python 2 & 3 will work) - This project was tested with **Python 3.10.11**
* Maven - This project's build was tested with **Maven 3.9.4**
You can find the installation instructions on their respective official websites.

Once you have Java and Python installed, you can proceed with the following steps:

1. Download the latest Py4J jar in your local machine. You can find the latest version of the jar [here](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/net.sf.py4j/py4j)
2. Clone this repository in your local machine
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory
4. Build the project using `mvn clean package` or `mvn clean package -DskipTests`
5. Start the Py4J GatewayServer in the foreground by executing `java -cp "/path/to/py4j.jar:target/Py4J-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar" py4j.GatewayServer`
6. Optional: If you don't want to start the gateway server process in foreground. You can also add the `py4j-jar` as `jarpath` and your application's `custom-jar` as `classpath` [here](https://github.com/sagarlakshmipathy/Py4J/blob/bfd6e78e6c987350a0fd5d576cbecb50eb3ad029/python/app.py#L19)

## Usage
* From your terminal, open python

    ```python```


* Run the below code which will let you use the underlying Java subtract method in python 
```python
from python.app import ApplicationWrapper

wrapper = ApplicationWrapper()
result = wrapper.subtract(2,1)

result  # will output 1
```

* In addition to the subtract method, you can access other Java objects and methods (native and custom) from Python. 
For example, to call a Java method named `getArrayLength` that takes a list of integers as a parameter, you can do the following:
```python
from python.app import ApplicationWrapper

wrapper = ApplicationWrapper()
result = wrapper.getArrayLength([1,2,3])

result  # will output 3
```
Note: Python doesn't have an equivalent data type for Java's `int[]`, so I've constructed a Java array from Python using Py4J. Refer to [this](https://github.com/sagarlakshmipathy/Py4J/blob/3fcda4718b837140317c889ef8c9bd86748bda2b/python/app.py#L30) code.

## Extending the application
You can extend the application by adding your own Java classes and methods.
* Create a new Java class in the `src/main/java/org/example/` directory or modify the existing `Application.java` class
* Add your custom methods to the class
* Add unit test cases for the Java methods in the `src/test/java/org/example/` directory
* Build the project using `mvn clean package`
* Modify the `pyhton/app.py` file to add your custom methods
* Add unit tests for your Python methods in the `python/tests/` directory
* Run the tests using `python -m pytest` from the project root directory
